# Dot-Files and Configuration Files

This repository contains personal configuration files and dot-files for backup and easy synchronization across different machines.

## Contents

Here are the key files included in this repository:

- `.bashrc`: Bash configuration file for shell settings.
- `.vimrc`: Configuration for the VIM text editor.

## Usage

To use these configurations, clone the repository and copy the desired files to your home directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ochi84/github.git
cp dot.bashrc ~/.bashrc
cp dot.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

## Caution

**Important:** Before copying over the .bashrc or .vimrc files, make sure to backup your existing configurations. This prevents any personal customizations from being overwritten unintentionally. You can do this by running:

```bash
cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc_backup
cp ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc_backup
```
