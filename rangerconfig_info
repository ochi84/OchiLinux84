# After starup, ranger ceates a directory "~/.config/ranger". To copy the default configuration to this directory issue the following command:

ranger --copy-config=all

# Afterwoards, set 'RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC=false' as an environment variable to avoid loading the global configuration in addition to the local.

# - 'rc.conf'		- startup commands and key bindings
# - 'commands.py'	- commands which are launched with ":"
# - 'rifle.conf'	- applications used when a given type of file is launched

# 'rc.conf' only needs to include changes from the default file as both are loaded. For 'commands.py', if you do not include the whole file, put this line at the top:

from ranger.api.commands import *
